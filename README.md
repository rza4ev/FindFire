# FindFire
Fire probablity prediction  
Fire Alarm Prediction is an open-source software designed to enhance fire safety and provide early warnings in various environments. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this project aims to predict the likelihood of fire incidents, allowing for timely responses and potentially preventing catastrophic events.
Key Features:

Machine Learning Models: We've implemented state-of-the-art machine learning models, including Random Forest, Neural Networks, and more, to analyze environmental data and make accurate predictions.
Real-time Monitoring: Our system continuously monitors environmental variables like temperature, humidity, and air quality to provide timely alarms.
Scalable: The project is designed to be easily scalable, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from residential homes to industrial complexes.
Open Source: Fire Alarm Prediction is open source, and we encourage contributions from the developer community to improve and expand its capabilities.   
Deployment with AWS EC2 Server:
We've taken our fire alarm prediction model to the next level by deploying it on a powerful AWS EC2 server. This deployment ensures real-time predictions and robust performance. By harnessing the scalability and reliability of Amazon Web Services, our mobile app users can benefit from the following features: https://github.com/YusifAghasalamli/find_fire

High Availability: The model is hosted on AWS EC2, guaranteeing high availability and consistent access to fire alarm predictions.
Low Latency: Thanks to AWS's global infrastructure, users experience minimal latency when interacting with the app.
Scalability: The deployment architecture is designed to handle increased loads, making it suitable for growing user bases.
Security: AWS's security measures help protect sensitive data and ensure the integrity of the application.
